        "On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 288 critics, with an average rating of 8.70/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Bolstered by powerful lead performances from Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones, No Country for Old Men finds the Coen brothers spinning cinematic gold out of Cormac McCarthy's grim, darkly funny novel.\"[104] The film also holds a rating of 92 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 39 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[105] Upon release, the film was widely discussed as a possible candidate for several Oscars,[106][107] before going on to receive eight nominations, and eventually winning four in 2008. Javier Bardem, in particular, has received considerable praise for his performance in the film.",
        "Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \"the best of the [Coens'] career so far\".[68] Rob Mackie of The Guardian also said that \"what makes this such a stand-out is hard to put your finger on – it just feels like an absorbing and tense two hours where everyone is absolutely on top of their job and a comfortable fit in their roles.\"[79] Geoff Andrew of Time Out London expressed that \"the film exerts a grip from start to end\". Richard Corliss of Time magazine chose the film as the best of the year and said that \"after two decades of being brilliant on the movie margins, the Coens are ready for their closeup, and maybe their Oscar\".[108] Paul Arendt of the BBC gave the film a full mark and said that it \"doesn't require a defense: it is a magnificent return to form\".[77] A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that \"for formalists – those moviegoers sent into raptures by tight editing, nimble camera work and faultless sound design – it's pure heaven.\"[65] Both Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from the ABC show At The Movies gave the film five stars, making No Country for Old Men the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2007. Both praised the film for its visual language and suspense, David commenting that \"Hitchcock wouldn't have done the suspense better\".[109][110]",
        "Occasional disapproval was voiced, with some critics noting the absence of a \"central character\" and \"climactic scene\"; its \"disappointing finish\" and \"dependen[ce] on an arbitrarily manipulated plot\"; or a general lack of \"soul\" and sense of \"hopelessness\".[45][111][112][113][114][115][116] Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph argued that \"Chigurh never develops as a character ... with material as strong as this, one would think they could do better than impute to him a sprawling inscrutability, a mystery that is merely pathological.\" He further accused it of being full of \"pseudo profundities in which [the Coen brothers] have always specialised.\"[117] In The Washington Post, Stephen Hunter criticized Chigurh's weapons as unintentionally humorous and lamented, \"It's all chase, which means that it offers almost zero in character development. Each of the figures is given, a la standard thriller operating procedure, a single moral or psychological attribute and then acts in accordance to that principle and nothing else, without doubts, contradictions or ambivalence.\"[118]",
        "No Country for Old Men was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four, including Best Picture. Additionally, Javier Bardem won Best Supporting Actor; the Coen brothers won Achievement in Directing (Best Director) and Best Adapted Screenplay. Other nominations included Best Film Editing (the Coen brothers as Roderick Jaynes), Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins), Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing.[120]",
        "Javier Bardem became the first Spanish actor to win an Oscar. \"Thank you to the Coens for being crazy enough to think I could do that and put one of the most horrible hair cuts in history on my head,\" Bardem said in his acceptance speech at the 80th Academy Awards. He dedicated the award to Spain and to his mother, actress Pilar Bardem, who accompanied him to the ceremony.[121]",
        "While accepting the award for Best Director at the 80th Academy Awards, Joel Coen said that \"Ethan and I have been making stories with movie cameras since we were kids\", recalling a Super 8 film they made titled \"Henry Kissinger: Man on the Go\". \"Honestly,\" he said, \"what we do now doesn't feel that much different from what we were doing then. We're very thankful to all of you out there for continuing to let us play in our corner of the sandbox.\"[119] It was only the second time in Oscar history that two individuals shared the directing honor (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins were the first, winning for 1961's West Side Story).[122]",
        "The film was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, winning two at the 65th Golden Globe Awards.[123] Javier Bardem won Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture and the Coen brothers won Best Screenplay – Motion Picture. The film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama, and Best Director (Ethan Coen and Joel Coen). Earlier in 2007 it was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.[124] The Screen Actors Guild gave a nomination nod to the cast for its \"Outstanding Performance\".[125] The film won top honors at the Directors Guild of America Awards for Joel and Ethan Coen. The film was nominated for nine BAFTAs in 2008 and won in three categories; Joel and Ethan Coen winning the award for Best Director, Roger Deakins winning for Best Cinematography and Javier Bardem winning for Best Supporting Actor.[126] It has also been awarded the David di Donatello for Best Foreign Film.",

        "While the film overall received six Academy Award nominations, Gerwig was not nominated for Best Director, which was deemed a snub.[24][95] Allison Pearson of The Telegraph labeled this a \"whole new standard of idiocy\", opining that it \"belittles women's experience\",[96] while Slate's Dana Stevens theorized that Academy members believe that \"women can only have a little recognition, as a treat\" and that Gerwig \"may now safely be ignored\" since she had been previously nominated for Lady Bird.[97] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, social psychologists Devon Proudfoot and Aaron Kay concluded that the snub was due to a \"general psychological tendency to unwittingly view women's work as less creative than men's\".[98]",
        "At the 92nd Academy Awards, Little Women received six nominations, including for Best Picture, Best Actress (Ronan), Best Supporting Actress (Pugh), Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Original Score, and won for Best Costume Design.[99] The film also received nine nominations at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, winning for Best Adapted Screenplay,[100] five nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards,[101] and two at the 77th Golden Globe Awards.[102] It was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of the year.[103] In December 2021, the film's screenplay was listed number eighty-nine on the Writers Guild of America's \"101 Greatest Screenplays of the 21st Century (So Far)\".[104]"

        "In North America, The Great Gatsby earned US$19.4 million on its opening Friday, including US$3.25 million from Thursday night and midnight shows.[61] It went on to finish in second place, behind Iron Man 3, during its opening weekend, with US$51.1 million.[62] This was the sixth-largest opening weekend for a film that did not debut in first place,[63] the second-largest opening weekend for a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio behind Inception,[64] and Luhrmann's highest-grossing movie.[65]",

        "Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal criticized the film as \"a tale told idiotically, full of noise and furor, signifying next to nothing.\"[68] Morgenstern felt the elaborate production designs were a misfire.[68] He likened the film's flaws to the decadent era which Fitzgerald criticized in his writing and stated that what is \"intractably wrong with the film is that there's no reality to heighten; it's a spectacle in search of a soul\".[68] The Chicago Reader review felt \"Luhrmann is exactly the wrong person to adapt such a delicately rendered story, and his 3D feature plays like a ghastly Roaring 20s blowout at a sorority house\".[69] In The Atlantic, Christopher Orr observed that \"the problem is that when the movie is entertaining it's not Gatsby, and when it's Gatsby it's not entertaining.\"[70]",
        "The positive reviews included A. O. Scott of The New York Times, who felt the adaptation was \"a lot of fun\" and \"less a conventional movie adaptation than a splashy, trashy opera, a wayward, lavishly theatrical celebration of the emotional and material extravagance that Fitzgerald surveyed with fascinated ambivalence\".[71] Scott advised \"the best way to enjoy the film is to put aside whatever literary agenda you are tempted to bring with you\".[71] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe reserved special praise for DiCaprio's performance, saying \"magnificent is the only word to describe this performance—the best movie Gatsby by far, superhuman in his charm and connections, the host of revels beyond imagining, and at his heart an insecure fraud whose hopes are pinned to a woman\".[72]",
        "The Scene Magazine gave the movie a \"B−\" rating, and praised the actors' performances, in particular saying that \"the stand-out actor is Joel Edgerton as Tom Buchanan doing an excellent job of showing the character's gruffness, despite the one-dimensionality given to him\".[73] A granddaughter of Fitzgerald, Eleanor Lanahan, praised the style and music of the film.[74]",
        "Tobey Maguire's role as Nick received mixed reviews from critics, with Philip French of The Guardian calling him \"miscast or misdirected\".[75] Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that \"Tobey Maguire is his usual recessive presence, barely registering as either a dynamic part of the events he describes or their watchful witness\",[76] and Elizabeth Weitzman of The New York Daily News opined that, despite \"the wry-observational skills needed for Nick's Midwestern decency\", the character is \"directed toward a wide-eyed, one-note performance\".[77] Rick Groen of The Globe and Mail was more positive of Maguire's character, saying \"our narrator, [is] prone to his occasionally purple rhetoric. But that imposed conceit, the image of a talented depressive writing from inside the bauble of his imagination, seems to validate his inflated prose and, better yet, lets us re-appreciate its inherent poetry\".[78]",

It's not just that it's a lot less funny than the book. It's also a lot less fun\".[28] On BBC Radio 5, Mark Kermode criticized the similarity of the film to director Chris Columbus's Harry Potter films, likening it to a Harry Potter parody book and dubbing it Benjamin Sniddlegrass and the Cauldron of Penguins.[29] This comment later sparked a satirical fan creation with precisely that title, narrated by Stephen Fry.[30]",

Am I talking about it? Promoting it? Sharing cool things? I am probably happy. Am I completely ignoring it and never mentioning it on social media? Yeah . . . that’s probably not a good sign. For instance, check out my website, rickriordan.com. Do you see any indication there that the Percy Jackson movies ever existed? No. No, you do not.\"[31][32][33] He also shared in the same email “The script as a whole is terrible. I don't simply mean that it deviates from the book, though certainly it does that to point of being almost unrecognizable as the same story. Fans of the books will be angry and disappointed.”[34]",

Alternately overly convoluted and predictable, the film relies too heavily on its twists while offering little in the way of character development, leaving its three central women as unrelatable and unlikable stereotypes.\"[37] Rolling Stone's Peter Travers gave the film a positive review, commenting that: \"[T]he movie gives away the game faster than the novel, but Emily Blunt digs so deep into the role of a blackout drunk and maybe murderer that she raises Girl to the level of spellbinder.\"[38]",

        "Initial reviews of the film focused primarily on Streep's performance, praising her for making an extremely unsympathetic character far more complex than she had been in the novel. \"With her silver hair and pale skin, her whispery diction as perfect as her posture, Ms. Streep's Miranda inspires both terror and a measure of awe,\" wrote A. O. Scott in The New York Times. \"No longer simply the incarnation of evil, she is now a vision of aristocratic, purposeful and surprisingly human grace.\"[72]",
        "David Edelstein, in New York magazine, criticized the film as \"thin\", but praised Streep for her \"fabulous minimalist performance\".[73] J. Hoberman, Edelstein's onetime colleague at The Village Voice, called the movie an improvement on the book and said Streep was \"the scariest, most nuanced, funniest movie villainess since Tilda Swinton's nazified White Witch in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.[74]",
        "Blunt, too, earned some favorable notice. \"[She] has many of the movie's best lines and steals nearly every scene she's in,\" wrote Clifford Pugh in the Houston Chronicle.[75] Other reviewers and fans concurred.[76][77] While all critics were in agreement about Streep and Blunt, they pointed to other weaknesses, particularly in the story. Reviewers familiar with Weisberger's novel assented to her judgment that McKenna's script greatly improved upon it.[62][72] An exception was Angela Baldassare at The Microsoft Network Canada, who felt the film needed more of the nastiness others had told her was abundant in the novel.[78]",
        "David Denby summed up this response in his New Yorker review: \"The Devil Wears Prada tells a familiar story, and it never goes much below the surface of what it has to tell. Still, what a surface!\"[62] Reactions to Hathaway's performance were not as unanimous as for many of her costars. Denby said \"she suggests, with no more than a panicky sidelong glance, what Weisberger takes pages to describe.\"[62] Whereas, Baldassare said she \"barely carrie[d] the load\".[78]",
        "Some media outlets allowed their present or former fashion reporters to weigh in on how realistic the movie was. Their responses varied widely. Booth Moore at Los Angeles Times chided Field for creating a \"fine fashion fantasy with little to do with reality,\" a world that reflects what outsiders think fashion is like rather than what the industry actually is. Unlike the movie, in her experience fashionistas were less likely to wear makeup and more likely to value edgier dressing styles (that would not include toe rings).[79]\n\"If they want a documentary, they can watch the History Channel\", retorted Field.[55] Fashion writer Hadley Freeman of The Guardian, likewise complained the film was awash in the sexism and clichés that, to her, beset movies about fashion in general.[80]",

Most found the fashion in the movie too safe and the beauty too overstated, more in tune with the 1980s than the 2000s. \"My job is to present an entertainment, a world people can visit and take a little trip,\" responded Field.[55]",
        "On its June 30 opening weekend, right before the Independence Day holiday, the film was on 2,847 screens. Through that Sunday, July 2, it grossed $27 million, second only to the big-budget Superman Returns,[82] breaking The Patriot's six-year-old record for the largest take by a movie released that holiday weekend that did not win the weekend;[83] a record that stood until Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs broke it in 2009.[84][c]",

Although it was never any week's top-grossing film, it remained in the top 10 through July. Its theatrical run continued through December 10, shortly before the DVD release.[86]",
        "\"The core marketing was definitely to women,\" Gabler recalls, \"but the men didn't resist going to the movie.\" She felt that male viewers responded favorably to the movie because they sought a glimpse inside fashion, and because Miranda \"was enjoyable to watch\". The release date helped generate word of mouth when people who had seen it discussed it at holiday gatherings. \"They were talking about it, like a summer reading book,\" said Gabler.[7]",

        "In an interview with Barbara Walters that aired the day the DVD was released, she called the film \"really entertaining\" and said she appreciated the \"decisive\" nature of Streep's portrayal. \"Anything that makes fashion entertaining and glamorous and interesting is wonderful for our industry. So I was 100 percent behind it.\"[6] Streep said Wintour was \"probably more upset by the book than the film\".[94] Wintour's popularity skyrocketed after her portrayal in The Devil Wears Prada. Streep said she did not base her character in The Devil Wears Prada on Anna Wintour, instead saying she was inspired by men she had known previously: \"Unfortunately you don't have enough women in power, or at least I don't know them, to copy.\"[95]",

He was again seated behind her some years later at a tennis tournament in Miami, and afterwards introduced himself. When he told her that he had directed The Devil Wears Prada, he recalls, she took her hand out of the handshake.[10]",
        "At the end of a 2024 performance of Gutenberg! The Musical!, Wintour played the producer (a cameo role given to a different celebrity every night) who offers stars Josh Gad and Andrew Rannells a contract to produce the musical they have been developing over the course of the show. She introduced Hathaway as her assistant, who said \"Still?\"[96]",
        "Weisberger's novel had been translated into 37 different languages, giving the movie a strong potential foreign audience. The international box office would ultimately deliver 60% of the film's gross. \"We did our European premiere at the Venice Film Festival\", Gabler says, where the city's gondoliers wore red T-shirts with the film's logo. \"So many people around the world were captivated by the glossy fashion world. It was sexy and international.\"[7]",

It would be the highest-grossing film that weekend in the United Kingdom, Spain and Russia, taking in $41.5 million overall.[97] Continued strong weekends as it opened across the rest of Europe helped it remain atop the overseas charts for the rest of the month.[98][99][100] By the end of the year only its Chinese opening remained; it was released there at the end of February 2007 and took in $2.4 million.[101]",

The only exceptions were Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Venezuela, where it was El diablo que viste Prada and El diablo se viste a la moda. In Poland, the title was Diabeł ubiera się u Prady which roughly means \"The Devil dresses (itself) at Prada\" rather than \"The Devil Wears Prada\". In Italian, the title was ″Il diavolo veste Prada\" which roughly means \"The devil wears Prada\". In Turkey, the title was \"Şeytan Marka Giyer,\" roughly translated as \"The Devil Wears Brand-Names\". In Romania, the title was \"Diavolul se îmbracă de la Prada,\" which roughly means \"The Devil Dresses itself from Prada\", the same construction being found in the French title, \"Le Diable s'habille en Prada\". The Japanese version is titled \"プラダを着た悪魔\", which translates as \"The devil wearing Prada\".",

        "The Godfather was a blockbuster, breaking many box office records to become the highest grossing film of 1972.[184] The film's opening day gross from five theaters was $57,829 with ticket prices increased from $3 to $3.50.[164] Prices in New York increased further at the weekend to $4, and the number of showings increased from four times a day to seven times a day.[164] The film grossed $61,615 in Toronto for the weekend[164] and $240,780 in New York,[185] for an opening weekend gross of $302,395. The film grossed $454,000 for the week in New York[164] and $115,000 in Toronto[168] for a first week gross of $568,800, which made it number one at the U.S. box office for the week.[186] In its first five days of national release, it grossed $6.8 million, taking its gross up to $7,397,164.[187] A week later its gross had reached $17,291,705[188] with the one week gross of around $10 million being an industry record.[189] It grossed another $8.7 million by April 9 to take its gross to $26,000,815.[190] After 18 weeks at number one in the United States, the film had grossed $101 million, the fastest film to reach that milestone.[191][192] Some news articles at the time proclaimed it was the first film to gross $100 million in North America,[169] but such accounts are erroneous; this record belongs to The Sound of Music, released in 1965.[193] It remained at number one in the US for another five weeks to bring its total to 23 consecutive weeks at number one before being unseated by Butterflies Are Free for one week before becoming number one for another three weeks.[194][195]",
        "The film eventually earned $81.5 million in theatrical rentals in the US and Canada during its initial release,[184][196] increasing its earnings to $85.7 million through a reissue in 1973,[197] and including a limited re-release in 1997,[198] it ultimately earned an equivalent exhibition gross of $135 million, with a production cost of $6.5 million.[167] It displaced Gone with the Wind to claim the record as the top rentals earner,[184] a position it would retain until the release of Jaws in 1975.[169][199] The film repeated its native success overseas, earning in total an unprecedented $142 million in worldwide theatrical rentals, to become the highest net earner.[200] Profits were so high for The Godfather that earnings for Gulf & Western Industries, Inc., which owned Paramount, jumped from 77 cents per share to $3.30 a share for the year, according to a Los Angeles Times article, dated December 13, 1972.[169] Re-released eight more times since 1997, it has grossed between $250 million and $291 million in worldwide box office receipts,[N 2] and adjusted for ticket price inflation in North America, ranks among the top 25 highest-grossing films.[201]",
        "The Godfather has received overwhelming critical acclaim and is seen as one of the greatest and most influential films of all time, particularly of the gangster genre.[202] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 151 reviews, with an average rating of 9.4/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"One of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes, The Godfather gets everything right; not only did the movie transcend expectations, it established new benchmarks for American cinema.\"[203] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, has assigned the film a score of 100 out of 100 based on 16 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[204]",
        "Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun Times praised Coppola's efforts to follow the storyline of the novel, the choice to set the film in the same time as the novel, and the film's ability to \"absorb\" the viewer over its three-hour run time.[205] Ebert named The Godfather \"The best film of 1972\".[206] The Chicago Tribune's Gene Siskel gave the film four out of four, commenting that it was \"very good\".[207]",
        "The Village Voice's Andrew Sarris believed Brando portrayed Vito Corleone well and that his character dominated each scene it appeared in, but felt Puzo and Coppola had the character of Michael Corleone too focused on revenge.[208] In addition, Sarris stated that Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, and James Caan were good in their respective roles.[208] Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote \"If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out of a merger of commerce and art, \"The Godfather\" is it.\"[209]",
        "Desson Howe of The Washington Post called the film a \"jewel\" and wrote that Coppola deserves most of the credit for the film.[210] Writing for The New York Times, Vincent Canby felt that Coppola had created one of the \"most brutal and moving chronicles of American life\" and went on to say that it \"transcends its immediate milieu and genre\".[211][212] Director Stanley Kubrick thought the film had the best cast ever and could be the best movie ever made.[213] Director Steven Spielberg listed it among his favorite films.[214] Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic wrote negatively of the film in a contemporary review, claiming that Pacino \"rattles around in a part too demanding for him,\" while also criticizing Brando's make-up and Rota's score.[215]",
        "Previous mafia films had looked at the gangs from the perspective of an outraged outsider.[216] In contrast, The Godfather presents the gangster's perspective of the Mafia as a response to corrupt society.[216] Although the Corleone family is presented as immensely rich and powerful, no scenes depict prostitution, gambling, loan sharking or other forms of racketeering.[217] George De Stefano argues that the setting of a criminal counterculture allows for unapologetic gender stereotyping (such as when Vito tells a weepy Johnny Fontane to \"act like a man\") and is an important part of the film's appeal.[218]",
        "Remarking on the fortieth anniversary of the film's release, film critic John Podhoretz praised The Godfather as \"arguably the great American work of popular art\" and \"the summa of all great moviemaking before it\".[219] Two years before, Roger Ebert had written in his journal that it \"comes closest to being a film everyone agrees ... is unquestionably great\".[220]"

        "In a negative review, Joe Neumaier of the New York Daily News said that World War Z \"is no summer thriller. It's an anemic actioner that fosters excitement like dead limbs as it lumbers toward a conclusion.\"[95] Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph thought the film had been affected by its troubled development, observing that \"the final product has an elaborate uselessness about it\", and the film has \"no heart to be found amid the guts.\"[96] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap said: \"For all its effectiveness at portraying the horror of possible human extinction, the film's actual humans are so soulless that this could just as well be the movie version of the video game Plants vs. Zombies.\"[97]",
